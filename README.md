# Re-numberMyScreenshots
This program is designed to compensate for deletions in the 
screenshot directory. It will rename(renumber) the files in ascending 
order, maintaining a natural order of remaining screenshots in your 
directory. Using the default screenshot format "Screenshot ().png"

Version 2.0 appeared to be functional after light testing.
I then encountered errors while renaming, when the program
attempted to rename files that already exist.

Version 3.0 is functional. It is now navigating the file creation errors.

Created a project in "Issues" for further development. 

Version 4.0 includes the space between the word Screenshot and the 
numbering that I had left out of the regex pattern. I had interpreted the
default pattern without it originally.

Reorder-Thru-CMD.py tested and added. This script is functional.
Designed to fix the issue. The issue persists.
