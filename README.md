# Re-numberMyScreenshots
This program is designed to compensate for deletions in the 
screenshot directory. It will rename the files in ascending order,
maintaining a natural order of remaining screenshots in your 
directory. 

Version 2.0 appeared to be functional after light testing.
Currently, the program is encountering an error while renaming 
files that already exist.
